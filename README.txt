# Satellite-aided consensus codes
Codes for:  Satellite-Aided Consensus for Scalable Blockchains

## Tips

1. Folders are all named in accordance with the figures in our paper
2. Tasks of Generating data and plotting figures are separated in all folders

## Structure

- current directory

	- common (function files for generating data and plotting figures)	
	
	- Figure4 (Plotted Figure: Analytical and simulation results of throughput and safety property of the proposed protocol [Static])
		- data (data generated by gen_Figure_4_data.m)
		- pic (output figures)
		- gen_Figure_4_data.m (generate data for plotting Figure_4)
		- plot_Figure_4.m (script for generating Figure_4 using generated data)
		- PrintFigToPaper.m (the standard plot function called by plot_Figure_4.m)
	
	- Figure5 (Plotted Figure: Comparison of the proposed protocol and PoW regarding throughput and safety [Static])
		- data (data generated by gen_Figure_5_data.m)
		- pic (output figures)
		- gen_Figure_5_data.m (generate data for plotting Figure_5)
		- plot_Figure_5.m (script for generating Figure_5 using generated data)
		- PrintFigToPaper.m (the standard plot function called by plot_Figure_5.m)

	- Figure6 (Plotted Figure: The impact of network delay on the throughput of the proposed protocol [Static])
		- data (data generated by gen_Figure_6_data.m)
		- pic (output figures)
		- gen_Figure_6_data.m (generate data for plotting Figure_6)
		- plot_Figure_6.m (script for generating Figure_6 using generated data)
		- PrintFigToPaper.m (the standard plot function called by plot_Figure_6.m)
